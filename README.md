# OpenGL
Learning OpenGL from https://learnopengl.com/ while expanding upon the tutorials to make a primitive game engine.

The code in this repository is very much a work in progress. I first started in 2018 when I was very new to C++ and OpenGL but picked it up again in August of 2019 to greater success.

This represents my second project in C++ (the first being [FMOD-DSP](https://github.com/KarateKidzz/FMOD-DSP)).
